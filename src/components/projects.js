			`BWM was the first website I made, this took place in the first block of HNC in my Web Design and Development course at City of Glasgow College for the subject of Website Essential Content.`,
			`The purpose of the BWM was to create a website with the purpose of transmitting musical content. The student chose the musical theme and the style of the page.`,

			`To carry out the project I divided it into four stages. The BWM´s first stage was the analysis stage, it was dedicated to understand the usage content. In it, I identified the purpose and objective of the website and detail the functional and non-functional requirements. Also, specify the target audience, creating user profiles and preparing a study of user interaction details.`,
			`In the second stage I carried out the design step. In BWM I created some wireframes and storyboards in Figma as well as a sitemap with the same tool. It also required a style guide specifying the colours and fonts and the reason for them.`,
			`Being the first website, BMW uses very simple technologies: HTML5 and CSS. I used a grid-based layout system to be able to order the elements and make the page responsive. You can view the page on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. BWM also required the use of photoshop and illustrator to create the logo. I decided to also create the festival posters since I added a part of the web titled festivals.`,
			`The fourth part was based on testing the page. For this I used W3Validator for HTML and W3Validator for CSS and in Lighthouse to validate BWM. In addition to completing testing level a test plan documentation was required.`,
